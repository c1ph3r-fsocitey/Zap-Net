![zapnet](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68302b5b-5810-4cdd-86bd-e1deba22d1ff)

## Overview

**Zap Net** is an Open Source Wi-Fi Deauther project designed for ethical hacking, penetration testing, and educational purposes. This tool allows you to:

- **Scan Networks**: Identify nearby Wi-Fi networks.
- **Deauthenticate Users**: Disconnect devices from a Wi-Fi network.
- **Create Fake Access Points**: Clone multiple networks to confuse users.

The goal of this project is to provide cybersecurity enthusiasts, students, and professionals with an easy-to-use tool for learning about wireless network vulnerabilities and testing security measures.

## 1. Project Description

**Zap Net** is built on the WeMos D1 Mini ESP8266 platform and uses a simple OLED display for user interaction. The device works by sending deauthentication frames to disconnect devices from a Wi-Fi network and can also create multiple fake networks to demonstrate security vulnerabilities. 

> **Note**: This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used for any malicious activities.

## 4. Software Installation

Follow these instructions to set up the firmware on your **Zap Net** device:

### Step 1: Install Arduino IDE
- Download and install the latest version of Arduino IDE from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

### Step 2: Add Board Manager URL
- Open Arduino IDE.
- Go to **Preferences** (`Ctrl+Comma` or File -> Preferences).
- In the **Additional Boards Manager URLs** field, add the following URL:
  ```
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpacehuhnTech/arduino/main/package_spacehuhn_index.json
  ```

### Step 3: Install Deauther Board
- Open the **Boards Manager** (Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager).
- Search for `Deauther ESP8266 Boards` and install it.

### Step 4: Configure the Board Settings
- In Arduino IDE, go to **Tools** -> **Board** -> **Deauther ESP8266 Boards** -> Select **Dstike Deauther**.
- Set the following parameters in **Tools**:
  - **Upload Speed**: `921600`
  - **Deauther Config**: `DSTIKE Deauther OLED V2`
  - **Flash Size**: `4MB (FS:1MB OTA:~1019KB)`
  - **Erase Flash**: `All Flash Contents`

### Step 5: Upload the Firmware
- Connect your WeMos D1 Mini to your computer.
- Compile and upload the provided firmware using the **Upload** button in Arduino IDE.
